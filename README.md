# [Hyperskill project] Unit Converter (Kotlin)
Get comfortable with the basics of coding: loops, conditions, and data input and output.

## About
When you travel, everything changes: people, languages, time zones, and even units. It may be difficult to read the temperature in Fahrenheit when you’ve always used Celsius, or to measure yourself in kilos if you’ve only used pounds. It’s no easy matter, though a nice unit converter could certainly help! In this project, you will write a converter that handles distance, weight, and temperature units – all the traveller’s essentials.

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Here’s what awaits you:

#### STAGE 1/5 Standard output
Display simple conversion examples: for instance, a standard measurement table.

#### STAGE 2/5 Let's get metric
Teach your program to convert kilometers to meters.

#### STAGE 3/5 Distances
Teach your program to handle other distance units - yards, feet and inches - and convert them to meters.

#### STAGE 4/5 Heavy duty
Now you can convert all distance units; time to enable your converter to work with weight measure units as well.

#### STAGE 5/5 Is it getting hot here?
Your converter is only missing one thing: temperatures. Teach it to convert Fahrenheir, Celsius and Kelvin, and your ultimate unit converter is ready.

## Training project
This project allows you to practice and strengthen your coding skills, helping you get ready for more advanced tasks ahead.
